            <p><b>Sri Lanka</b>, formerly <i>Ceylon</i>, island country lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from 
                peninsular India by the Palk Strait. It is located between latitudes 5°55′ and 9°51′ N 
                and longitudes 79°41′ and 81°53′ E and has a maximum length of 268 miles (432 km) and a 
                maximum width of 139 miles (224 km).
            </p>
            <p>
                Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between 
                Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a crossroads of maritime routes traversing the 
                Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian 
                civilizations. Ancient Greek geographers called it <i>Taprobane</i>. Arabs referred to it as 
                <i>Serendib</i>. Later European mapmakers called it Ceylon, a name still used occasionally for 
                trade purposes. It officially became Sri Lanka in 1972.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distinctive civilization of Sri Lanka, with roots that can be traced back to the 6th 
                century BCE, is characterized by two factors: the preservation of Theravada Buddhism 
                (the orthodox school of Buddhism having its literary traditions in the Pali language) and 
                the development over two millennia of a sophisticated system of irrigation in the drier 
                parts of the country. This civilization was further enriched by the influences of Hinduism 
                and Islam.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule, Sri Lanka became an independent country, 
                and it was admitted to the United Nations seven years later. The country is a member of the 
                Commonwealth and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Colombo</b>, which emerged as the main urban centre during British rule, remains the executive 
                and judicial capital of Sri Lanka; <b>Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte</b>, a Colombo suburb, is the 
                legislative capital. For administrative purposes, the country has been divided into nine 
                provinces and subdivided into 25 districts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sri Lanka is densely populated. The majority of its people are poor, live in rural areas, and 
                depend on agriculture for their livelihood. A physical environment of wide-ranging diversity 
                makes Sri Lanka one of the world’s most scenic countries. As the home of several ethnic groups, 
                each with its own cultural heritage, Sri Lanka also has a highly varied cultural landscape.

        <h3>History of Tourism</h3>
        <hr>
        <img width="400px" src="images/tour10.webp" alt="tour01-image" style="float: right">
        <p>
            In 1966, the Government decided to develop tourism in a planned and a systematic manner, after 
            identifying the need to set up an institutional framework. The Ceylon Tourist Board (created by 
            the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No. 10 of 1966) and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation (created by 
            Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act of 1966) were set up duly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Created to promote rapid economic development, through the development of foreign tourism, the 
            Ceylon Tourist Board (CTB) was a statutory body that allowed greater freedom in decision making 
            and flexibility in financial management.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legislation also covered the establishment of a national holiday resort company, which planned 
            various types of accommodation and resort areas. Moreover it included the setting up of an authority 
            under the Tourist Board to manage and administer each resort. The Act conferred powers for the 
            Protection of Highways and Places of Scenic Beauty and vested authority in the Ceylon Tourist Board 
            for the Registration and Classification of Tourist Hotels and all other tourist services including 
            travel agencies. The Tourist Development Act of 1968 provided the Ceylon Tourist Board with the 
            statutory authority to develop tourism on a planned and controlled basis

            <br/><p><b>What is the best time of year to visit Sri Lanka? </b></p><p>
                Sri Lanka is a year round destination as it is fortunate to have two monsoons that occur in different halves of the island at different times. So if you wish to enjoy the western and southern coastal resorts when the weather is best, come between December and April. However, even during the monsoon, sunny, warm days are common, although afternoon or evening showers can be expected. 
                </p><br/><p><b>Is Sri Lanka safe from Terrorism? </b></p><p>
                Up till May 2009, Sri Lanka had a conflict with the LTTE who wanted a separate state for the Tamils in the North and East of the country. A lot was written in the press in the UK as to how dangerous it was to travel to Sri Lanka. It must be remembered that, throughout the conflict, not one single tourist has been injured or killed. As from May 2009, this conflict ended and Sri Lanka is now at peace.
                </p><br/><p><b>Is it possible to combine a visit to Sri Lanka with the Maldives? </b></p><p>
                Yes, this is a popular option for many travelers, who want to experience the diverse settings and unique culture of Sri Lanka, but also would like to experience the world renowned beaches and diving of the Maldives. Flights between Colombo and Male are numerous and take only 1 hour. You can book an itinerary taking in both countries.
                </p><br/><p><b>What type of accommodation is available? </b></p><p>
                Whatever type you seek is available in Sri Lanka's surprisingly wide range of accommodation options. Five-star hotels, resort hotels, boutique properties, guest houses, home stays, and all manner of other establishments can be found, especially along the western and southern coasts and Kandy and the hill country. It is also possible to rent houses. In a category of their own are government-run rest-houses, originally used by British colonists on their travels. As a result many are colonial buildings, and set in peaceful locations. 
                </p><br/><p><b>What kind of food is available? </b></p><p>
                Rice is consumed with curries (eggplant, potato, green banana, chicken and fish) that range from delicately-spiced to near-dynamite. There are also hoppers, string hoppers (steamed rice noodles) and pittu. Lamprais - rice and accompaniments baked in plantain leaves - is a legacy of the Dutch. Fresh fish, prawns, crab, squid and crayfish are readily available. Desserts include buffalo curd topped with palm-honey, and the caramel-like wattalapam. Tasty snacks known as short eats are excellent for trips.<br/>
                Delectable fruit includes the popular mango, pineapple, banana and papaya, and also the lesser-known but distinctive examples such as sapodilla, mangos teen, rambutan, wood apple, custard apple and beli. Colombo has an impressive range of restaurants specializing in international cuisine.
