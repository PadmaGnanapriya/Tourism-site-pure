            <p><b>Sri Lanka</b>, formerly <i>Ceylon</i>, island country lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from 
                peninsular India by the Palk Strait. It is located between latitudes 5°55′ and 9°51′ N 
                and longitudes 79°41′ and 81°53′ E and has a maximum length of 268 miles (432 km) and a 
                maximum width of 139 miles (224 km).
            </p>
            <p>
                Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between 
                Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a crossroads of maritime routes traversing the 
                Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian 
                civilizations. Ancient Greek geographers called it <i>Taprobane</i>. Arabs referred to it as 
                <i>Serendib</i>. Later European mapmakers called it Ceylon, a name still used occasionally for 
                trade purposes. It officially became Sri Lanka in 1972.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distinctive civilization of Sri Lanka, with roots that can be traced back to the 6th 
                century BCE, is characterized by two factors: the preservation of Theravada Buddhism 
                (the orthodox school of Buddhism having its literary traditions in the Pali language) and 
                the development over two millennia of a sophisticated system of irrigation in the drier 
                parts of the country. This civilization was further enriched by the influences of Hinduism 
                and Islam.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule, Sri Lanka became an independent country, 
                and it was admitted to the United Nations seven years later. The country is a member of the 
                Commonwealth and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
            </p>

                <b>Colombo</b>, which emerged as the main urban centre during British rule, remains the executive 
                and judicial capital of Sri Lanka; <b>Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte</b>, a Colombo suburb, is the 
                legislative capital. For administrative purposes, the country has been divided into nine 
                provinces and subdivided into 25 districts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sri Lanka is densely populated. The majority of its people are poor, live in rural areas, and 
                depend on agriculture for their livelihood. A physical environment of wide-ranging diversity 
                makes Sri Lanka one of the world’s most scenic countries. As the home of several ethnic groups, 
                each with its own cultural heritage, Sri Lanka also has a highly varied cultural landscape.

        <h3>History of Tourism...</h3>

        <p>
            In 1966, the Government decided to develop tourism in a planned and a systematic manner, after 
            identifying the need to set up an institutional framework. The Ceylon Tourist Board (created by 
            the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No. 10 of 1966) and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation (created by 
            Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act of 1966) were set up duly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Created to promote rapid economic development, through the development of foreign tourism, the 
            Ceylon Tourist Board (CTB) was a statutory body that allowed greater freedom in decision making 
            and flexibility in financial management.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legislation also covered the establishment of a national holiday resort company, which planned 
            various types of accommodation and resort areas. Moreover it included the setting up of an authority 
            under the Tourist Board to manage and administer each resort. The Act conferred powers for the 
            Protection of Highways and Places of Scenic Beauty and vested authority in the Ceylon Tourist Board 
            for the Registration and Classification of Tourist Hotels and all other tourist services including 
            travel agencies. The Tourist Development Act of 1968 provided the Ceylon Tourist Board with the 
            statutory authority to develop tourism on a planned and controlled basis
        </p>
        <p>
            In October 2007 the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005 came into effect. With the circulation of the new 
            Tourism act, the Sri Lanka Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966, which was in effect for the past 41 
            years, was replaced.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of the provisions contained in the new act, the Tourism Development Fund was legally 
            constituted, with 2 main sources remitting finances to the fund. By way of 1/3 of the Airport 
            Tax collections and 1% of the Turnover of all Sri Lanka Tourist Board registered establishments. 
            The Act provided for the setting up of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Sri Lanka 
            Promotions Bureau, Sri Lanka Convention Bureau and Sri Lanka Institute of Hotel Management, thereby 
            replacing the Sri Lanka Tourist Board.
