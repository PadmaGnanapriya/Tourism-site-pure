            <h3>Sri Lanka</h3>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Sri Lanka</b>, formerly <i>Ceylon</i>, island country lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from 
                peninsular India by the Palk Strait. It is located between latitudes 5°55′ and 9°51′ N and longitudes 
                79°41′ and 81°53′ E and has a maximum length of 268 miles (432 km) and a maximum width of 139 miles (224 km).

                Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between 
                Sri Lanka and India from ancient times. At a crossroads of maritime routes traversing the 
                Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian 
                civilizations. Ancient Greek geographers called it <i>Taprobane</i>. Arabs referred to it as 
                <i>Serendib</i>. Later European mapmakers called it Ceylon, a name still used occasionally for 
                trade purposes. It officially became Sri Lanka in 1972.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distinctive civilization of Sri Lanka, with roots that can be traced back to the 6th 
                century BCE, is characterized by two factors: the preservation of Theravada Buddhism 
                (the orthodox school of Buddhism having its literary traditions in the Pali language) and 
                the development over two millennia of a sophisticated system of irrigation in the drier 
                parts of the country. This civilization was further enriched by the influences of Hinduism 
                and Islam.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule, Sri Lanka became an independent country, 
                and it was admitted to the United Nations seven years later. The country is a member of the 
                Commonwealth and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Colombo</b>, which emerged as the main urban centre during British rule, remains the executive 
                and judicial capital of Sri Lanka; <b>Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte</b>, a Colombo suburb, is the 
                legislative capital. For administrative purposes, the country has been divided into nine 
                provinces and subdivided into 25 districts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sri Lanka is densely populated. The majority of its people are poor, live in rural areas, and 
                depend on agriculture for their livelihood. A physical environment of wide-ranging diversity 
                makes Sri Lanka one of the world’s most scenic countries. As the home of several ethnic groups, 
                each with its own cultural heritage, Sri Lanka also has a highly varied cultural landscape.

            <h3>Plant and animal life</h3>
            <hr>

            <p>            
                Sri Lanka&#39;s common vegetation covers around one-third of the entire arrive region. The climax 
                vegetation (i.e., common vegetation allowed to create continuous) in most parts of the nation 
                is timberland. Within the Damp Zone, tropical damp evergreen woodland dominates within the lowlands, 
                and submontane and montane evergreen woodlands win within the good countries. The Dry Zone includes 
                a climax vegetation of dry evergreen woodland and damp deciduous timberland, with timberlands giving 
                way to a hindered, shrubby, xerophytic (drought-tolerant) vegetation in its driest parts. Within 
                the most elevated regions of the Central Good countries, woodlands tend to be meager and blended 
                with prairies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of Sri Lanka&#39;s climax vegetation cover has been intensely exhausted by broad clearing of 
                woodlands for settlements, extraction of timber, and farming. As it were the Sinharaja timberland 
                and the Crest Wild of the southwestern insides stay as critical leftovers of the Damp Zone’s 
                unique evergreen woodlands. The timberlands found in most parts of the Dry Zone are auxiliary 
                vegetation, which likely created after hundreds of a long time of rehashed clearing and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The virgin woodlands of Sri Lanka are wealthy in their assortment and abundance of greenery and 
                fauna. Natural life, counting elephants, panthers, bears, buffalo, and peafowl, and tree species 
                such as midnight, mahogany, satinwood, and teak are being quickly drained by unpredictable abuse.

            <h3>Ethnic composition</h3>
            <hr><img width="400px" src="nations.webp" alt="nations-image" style="float: right">

            <p>            
                Ethnic, devout, and phonetic qualifications in Sri Lanka are basically the same. Three ethnic 
                groups—Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim—make up more than 99 percent of the country&#39;s populace, with the 
                Sinhalese alone bookkeeping for about three-fourths of the individuals. The Tamil portion comprises 
                two groups—Sri Lankan Tamils (long-settled relatives from southeastern India) and Indian Tamils (later 
                foreigners from southeastern India, most of whom were vagrant specialists brought to Sri Lanka beneath 
                British run the show). Somewhat more than one-eighth of the overall populace has a place to the previous 
                gather. Muslims, who follow their beginning back to Middle easterner dealers of the 8th century, 
                account for approximately 7.5 percent of the populace. Burghers (a community of blended European 
                plummet), Parsis (workers from western India), and Veddas (respected as the native occupants of the 
                nation) add up to less than 1 percent of the populace.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sinhalese constitute the majority in the southern, western, central, and north-central parts of 
                the country. In the rural areas of the Wet Zone lowlands, they account for more than 95 percent of 
                the population. The foremost concentration of the Sri Lankan Tamils lies in the Jaffna Peninsula and 
                in the adjacent districts of the northern lowlands. Smaller agglomerations of this group are also 
                found along the eastern littoral where their settlements are juxtaposed with those of the Muslims. 
                The main Muslim concentrations occur in the eastern lowlands. In other areas, such as Colombo, Kandy, 
                Puttalam, and Gampaha, Muslims form a small but important segment of the urban and suburban population. 
                The Indian Tamils, the vast majority of whom are plantation workers, live in large numbers in the higher 
                areas of the Central Highlands.

            <h3>Language and religion</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Among the foremost ethnic bunches, dialect and religion decide character. Whereas the mother tongue of the 
                Sinhalese is Sinhala—an Indo-Aryan language—the Tamils talk the Dravidian dialect of Tamil. Once more, 
                whereas more than 90 percent of the Sinhalese are Buddhists, both Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils are 
                overwhelmingly Hindu. The Muslims—adherents of Islam—usually talk Tamil. Christianity draws its adherents 
                (almost 7 percent of the populace) from among the Sinhalese, Tamil, and Burgher communities.
