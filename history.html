                In 1966, the Government decided to develop tourism in a planned and a systematic manner, after 
                identifying the need to set up an institutional framework. The Ceylon Tourist Board (created by 
                the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No. 10 of 1966) and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation (created by 
                Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act of 1966) were set up duly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Created to promote rapid economic development, through the development of foreign tourism, the 
                Ceylon Tourist Board (CTB) was a statutory body that allowed greater freedom in decision making 
                and flexibility in financial management.
            </p>
            <p>
                The legislation also covered the establishment of a national holiday resort company, which planned 
                various types of accommodation and resort areas. Moreover it included the setting up of an authority 
                under the Tourist Board to manage and administer each resort. The Act conferred powers for the 
                Protection of Highways and Places of Scenic Beauty and vested authority in the Ceylon Tourist Board 
                for the Registration and Classification of Tourist Hotels and all other tourist services including 
                travel agencies. The Tourist Development Act of 1968 provided the Ceylon Tourist Board with the 
                statutory authority to develop tourism on a planned and controlled basis
            </p>
            <p>
                In October 2007 the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005 came into effect. With the circulation of the new 
                Tourism act, the Sri Lanka Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966, which was in effect for the past 41 
                years, was replaced.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of the provisions contained in the new act, the Tourism Development Fund was legally 
                constituted, with 2 main sources remitting finances to the fund. By way of 1/3 of the Airport 
                Tax collections and 1% of the Turnover of all Sri Lanka Tourist Board registered establishments. 
                The Act provided for the setting up of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Sri Lanka 
                Promotions Bureau, Sri Lanka Convention Bureau and Sri Lanka Institute of Hotel Management, thereby 
                replacing the Sri Lanka Tourist Board.
